# Molecule Genetic Algorithms (Mol_GA)

A simple, lightweight package for genetic algorithms on molecules.

**Why genetic algorithms?**

In my research, I've found GAs to be pretty powerful algorithms for molecular optimization.
At the same time, existing implementations are not very standard, hard to customize, and have some bugs.
The goal of `mol_ga` is to address this problem by providing a lightweight, high-quality implementation
of some genetic algorithms for researchers to use.
